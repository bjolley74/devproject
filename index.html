        <h2>A little About Me</h2>
        <p id='intro'>I am a 46 year old former customer service guru (read as 20+ years in various 
            customer service roles) ending most recently as an Auto Underwriter at a State Farm Agent call
            center where I helped State Farm Agents with their various questions on servicing auto policies. 
            I am now, with the help of Codecademy.com, studing python, data science, HTML and CSS to help 
            brush off my computer science skills that I gained in college with my 
            Math/Computer Information Systems degree I earned in 1998. I am building this site as 
            part of the Codecademy's HTML and CSS class.
        </p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p id='goals'>
            My goals as part of this class is mostly to learn CSS and to 
            brush up on my HTML5 as well learn any changes to HTML since I last
            played with it. I hope to gain a lot out of this project and also be able to
            use it to show what I can do. I will post this on my Github site
